My 2024 wasn‚Äôt my best, but I struggled a lot. I struggle with eliminating my bad habits and building good habits, and I procrastinate a lot.Like a lot of procrastination.Do you want to know what my goals are in 2024 at the beginning?It was eliminating all my bad habits, building a writing system all day, and reading a book every week. Well, it doesn‚Äôt turn out pretty well.But a journey is still a journey.Progress is still progress.And I learn a big lesson that I will bring in 2025:‚ÄúEvery failure is a step closer to success. Relapse is not a reset to zero. It‚Äôs just another step for success.‚ÄùAnd to make the best of my 2025, I need a plan. A strategic plan that can eliminate distractions, bring focus, and improve myself effectively. Without a roadmap, I will be drowned with distractions.So, here‚Äôs my ultimate plan for 2025.I adjust it based on gradual progression, goal setting, and effectiveness in success. No cold turkey. No monk mode. Only a joyful journey along the way.I‚Äôm not asking you to follow this exactly and strictly.I really hope that you can adjust it as best you can.Erase something you don‚Äôt likeFollow something you think is right.Change something you might need to be replaced.Let‚Äôs make this 2025 another best year of our lives.Step 1: Write down 10 goals.Just write 10 big goals that you really want to achieve.Oh, and don‚Äôt write it like this:‚ÄúI want to become rich.‚ÄùBe specific.For example:‚ÄúI want to have an income of $10,000/month through writing.‚ÄùNow write another goal until you reach 10 lists. If you only get 5 or less, it‚Äôs fine. At least you have some. And it doesn‚Äôt have to be 10 goals.You can write down more than 10 goals.Then from that, circle 1 goal that you think is the key goal.Key goals are goals that will tremendously change your life. It‚Äôs like the biggest stepping stone or might be the deepest root that is holding you back from improving. So, the goal is to work on that.You can write that one goal on another piece of paper or on a blank space.Step 2: Plan how you‚Äôre going to achieve thatNow, how are you going to achieve that goal?My goal is building a writing system that will help me be consistent and disciplined in my writing. There are a lot of ways to achieve that goal. I can set up a schedule, make a habit tracker, find an accountability partner, and many more.Now, you can list down as many as you can to achieve that goal.For example:I want to achieve $10,000/month.How I‚Äôm going to achieve that is by working on my business for 12 hours a day on client work, outreach, building a personal brand, and selling products or courses.You eventually need to make it specific and more detailed than that. This will help you to know what the step to start on achieving that goal is. The more specific you are, the easier it is for you to stick with it.After that, let‚Äôs make it clear.Step 3: Start smallYou know me.I‚Äôm a big fan of starting small.From the ‚Äòhow‚Äô list you have, pick the easiest step to start. For me, it was making a schedule. It‚Äôs pretty easy to make a schedule because I only write down time and activities adjusted based on my environment.From there, you can start doing the next step and the next step until you achieve the end goal.Step 4: Tackle one by one until you achieve all your goals.After you tackle it one by one, it will be much easier for you to tackle the next goal.I don‚Äôt recommend doing all goals at once. I recommend that you start focusing on one step, which is one goal at a time and one small step toward that goal. If you haven‚Äôt finished the first goal yet, try to finish it.But still, if you are someone who likes to wait and change steps, it‚Äôs up to you.Make the days count.Every day, make progress toward that specific goal.Step 5: Don‚Äôt get distracted.There will be many distractions out there.You need to be ready.After you know what to do after writing the first small step, you can start writing it down or at least be aware of distractions on the road. This helped you to be prepared and avoid the distraction easily.My distraction in building a writing system is waking up late.If I set the writing system schedule at 8 am in the morning, it would be pretty hard for me to start the writing system at 9 am if I woke up late. So, my restriction is always waking up before 8 am and being ready for that particular time.Shiny things also need to be avoided.I sometimes get distracted by dropshipping, SMMA, and many other online businesses out there. That‚Äôs why I remind myself of the goal I aim for so that I don‚Äôt get distracted. All of those businesses are great, but it‚Äôs much greater to focus on one thing at a time.It teaches you persistence in not giving up on one thing.ConclusionThis is my ultimate plan to make 2025 another best year of my life.A plan is just a plan. It‚Äôs useless without implementation. It‚Äôs a waste if I give up.So things you can learn are not giving up. Even if the road seems pretty rocky and hurts to step on, keep going. Be consistent and focus on doing the ‚Äòhow‚Äô until you achieve your goals.If you can start today, start.Don‚Äôt wait until 2025.The best plan is actually starting.Let Me Help YouI am a professional ghostwriter specializing in creating compelling articles, stories, and SEO-optimized content that not only resonates with audiences but also drives results.
